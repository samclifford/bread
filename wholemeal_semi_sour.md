# Wholemeal semi-sourdough

Source: Bread and Butter Project

Makes: 2 loaves

Hydration: 63%

Notes: I usually just halve this and do a single loaf

## Ingredients

* 115g white baker's flour
* 350g whole wheat baker's flour
* 10g salt
* 5g fresh yeast (or 1/2 tsp instant yeast per loaf)
* 230g water at 37C
* 340g white starter at 100% hydration

## Method

### Hand mixed

1. Mix water and starter (and fresh yeast if using) together until consistent in texture
2. Put all dry ingredients (including instant yeast if using) in a large bowl; pour in wet mixture and, with a wet hand, mix together to form a rough dough, then knead for 30 seconds. Let rest for 45 minutes, covered.
3. (Stretch and fold technique) Using a wet hand, grab the dough so that your thumb is in the middle of the top of the dough and your fingers are in the middle on the bottom. Holding lightly, stretch the dough out to 2-3 times its length (avoid tearing it!) and fold it back over the end of the dough that is is still in the middle of the bowl. Rotate the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat this process, ensuring that you do not tear the dough. Continue until you have done 2 complete turns. Rest 45 minutes, covered.
4. Repeat step 3.
5. Turn the dough out of the bowl on to a lightly floured surface. Flatten into a wide circle and then fold into a square by folding in opposite sides of the circle so that they overlap a little in the middle. Gently roll into a ball in a circular motion. Divide the dough in half.
6. Pre-shape each loaf by placing your hands at its sides and turning the dough, tucking one side underneath as you turn. This is to add tension to the dough's surface. Let rest on a lightly floured surface, covered with a damp tea towel for 30 minutes.
7. Shape as a batard by turning the pre-shaped half upside down on a lightly floured surface, flattening gently and stretch out to a rectangle 2-3 times wide as it is long. Fold into thirds and, using the paper plane method, fold the top corners to a point, then fold the point down into the dough. Repeat until you're up to the last fold, then fold it over and pinch the seam shut.
8. Place the batard seam side up in a floured banneton, couche, or oval-shaped bowl/dish with a floured tea towel in it (use rice flour here, as wheat flour will get sticky when wet), cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rest for 45 minutes so that the loaf has increased in size by 2/3
9. Place baking stone in the oven and pre-heat to 200C, ensuring that the stone has plenty of time to warm up to 200C. Sprinkle a little rice flour or semolina on the stone in order to prevent the loaf sticking, then turn out the loaf from the banneton, score with long diagonal slashes that overlap by 1/3, steam the oven (door slightly ajar) with a spray bottle for 10 seconds, reduce temperature to 170C and bake for 30-35 minutes, turning the loaf 180 degrees about 20 minutes into baking to ensure an even bake. 
10. The loaf is done when you tap the bottom and it sounds like a drum. Allow to cool completely before slicing, as cutting too early causes the steam to escape and dries the bread out.

### Stand mixer (not a food processor)

1. Put everything in the stand mixer, mix on slow for 4 minutes, medium-high for 6 minutes.
2. Oil a container (or large bowl) and let dough rest for 60 minutes.
3. Knock back dough by stretching into a rectangle three times as wide as it is tall and fold over. Put back in container for 60 minutes.
4. Continue from step 5 above.
